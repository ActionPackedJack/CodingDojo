Launch virtual environment by navigating to the folder that contains the environment and running terminal command:
source djangoEnv/bin/activate
Navigate that same terminal window into the place where you want the project folder to be.
django-admin startproject THE NAME OF YOUR PROJECT
Navigate to that folder
mkdir apps
Create an app by navigating to apps and running:
python ..manage.py startapp THE NAME OF YOUR APP
If you make an app, navigate to the subfolder with the same name as your project and open settings.py  Find the list of INSTALLED APPS =[], and add ‘apps.THENAMEOFYOURAPP’ to that list.
When you’re ready to launch your app, navigate a terminal window to the top folder with your project’s name and run…
python manage.py runserver
…then open a browser window to…
localhost:8000
You can stop the server by pressing ctrl-C.
If you made any apps, go to their subfolder in your apps folder and touch urls.py
Open that urls.py file and add import url to the top line after “from django”
Then, on the next line, make sure it says “from . import views”
